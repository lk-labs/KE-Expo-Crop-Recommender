> ## 1. Encoding the crops

```{r}
# Encoding the Kenyan crops
crop_dict <- list(
    'Tea' = 1, 'Coffee' = 2, 'Avocado' = 3, 'Macadamia Nuts' = 4, 
    'French Beans' = 5, 'Snow Peas' = 6, 'Passion Fruit' = 7, 
    'Mango' = 8, 'Pineapple' = 9, 'Flowers (Roses)' = 10, 'Cabbage' = 11, 
    'Sugarcane' = 12, 'Cashew Nuts' = 13, 'Tomatoes' = 14, 'Spinach' = 15, 
    'Carrots' = 16, 'Coconuts' = 17, 'Sisal' = 18, 'Sesame Seeds' = 19, 
    'Tobacco' = 20, 'Chillies' = 21, 'Pyrethrum' = 22

# Apply encoding using match() and convert to factor
kenyancrops$crop_num <- as.factor(match(kenyancrops$label, names(crop_dict)))

# Drop the 'label' column
kenyancrops <- kenyancrops %>% select(-label)
```

## 2. Train Test Split

```{r}
set.seed(42)

# Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(kenyancrops$crop_num, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
trainData <- kenyancrops[trainIndex,]
testData <- kenyancrops[-trainIndex,]

# Separate features (X) and target (Y)
x_train <- trainData %>% select(-crop_num)
y_train <- trainData$crop_num
x_test <- testData %>% select(-crop_num)
y_test <- testData$crop_num

```

## 3. Feature Scaling

```{r}
# Scale the features using Min-Max Scaling
preProcess_scale <- preProcess(x_train, method = 'range')
x_train_scaled <- predict(preProcess_scale, x_train)
x_test_scaled <- predict(preProcess_scale, x_test)

```

## 4. Model Training

```{r}
# Define trainControl
control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5, verboseIter = FALSE)

# Initialize models training algorithms
models <- list(
    multinom = train(x_train_scaled, y_train, method = "multinom", trControl = control), # Multinomial Logistic Regression

print(model_accuracies)


# Select the best model based on accuracy
best_model_name <- names(which.max(model_accuracies))
print(paste("Best model:", best_model_name))

```

## 5. Fit the Best (Random Forest) model

```{r}
# Fit the Random Forest model (as it’s likely the best)
if (best_model_name == "rf") {
    rfc <- models$rf
} else {
    rfc <- randomForest(x_train_scaled, y_train)  # Fallback to RF if not best
}

recommendation <- function(N, P, K, temperature, humidity, ph, rainfall) {
    # Create a new data frame with the exact column names from your dataset
    features <- data.frame(
        N = N, P = P, K = K, 
        temperature = temperature, humidity = humidity, 
        ph = ph, rainfall = rainfall
    )
    
    # Ensure the input columns match the training data columns
    features <- features[, colnames(x_train), drop = FALSE]

    # Scale the input features using the same scaler used in training
    features_scaled <- predict(preProcess_scale, features)

    # Make a prediction using the trained Random Forest model
    prediction <- predict(rfc, features_scaled)
    return(prediction)

```

## 6. Predictive System Testing

```{r}

temperature <- 40; humidity <- 20
ph <- 30; rainfall <- 50

# Get the crop prediction
predict_crop <- recommendation(N, P, K, temperature, humidity, ph, rainfall)
